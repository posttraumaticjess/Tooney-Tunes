# Tooney-Tunes
Single-view app that would definitely get copyrighted by Warner Bros.
Offers on-demand music streaming, so long as the music of choice is part of the Looney Tunes soundtrack.
This version includes a UI image of Bugs Bunny on the main interface, as it was executively decided (by me) that the Bugs Bunny version would be more marketable to consumers than the Daffy Duck version that was created in a separate branch.
